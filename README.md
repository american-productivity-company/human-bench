# Human-Bench 🤖→🧑

**A benchmark for human-like capability from virtual humans made of AI Agents.**

Human-Bench evaluates AI agents on realistic, multi-modal communication tasks that mirror how humans actually interact with personal assistants—across SMS, email, and voice calls, with context that spans days or weeks.

## Why Human-Bench?

Existing benchmarks test coding ability (SWE-bench), general reasoning (GAIA), or tool use (τ-bench). But none evaluate what makes a truly useful personal assistant:

- 📱 **Multi-modal communication** (SMS, Email, Voice, Slack, Teams)
- 🔗 **Cross-channel context** ("About that email I sent..." during a phone call)
- ⚡ **Priority management** (handling interruptions gracefully)
- 📅 **Long-term coherence** (planning a wedding over weeks)
- 🎯 **Human-like interaction patterns** (not just Q&A)
- 🔒 **Security & Privacy** (resisting unauthorized access attempts)
- 👥 **Team coordination** (managing multiple users and delegation)

## How It Works

**Human-Bench is a hosted benchmark service.** We handle all testing and evaluation.

1. **Register your AI assistant** at [humanbench.ai](https://humanbench.ai)
2. **Provide contact info**: Your persona's phone number, email, and name
3. **We run the tests**: We send SMS, emails, and phone calls to your assistant
4. **Get your score**: See detailed results and compare on the public leaderboard

No setup required - just register and test!

## Benchmark Structure

```
Level 1: Basic (Single turn, single channel)         → Target: 95%+ success
Level 2: Multi-Turn (Conversations)                  → Target: 85%+ success
Level 3: Real Work Tasks (Meetings, expenses, etc.)  → Target: 75%+ success
Level 4: Cross-Modal (Context across channels)       → Target: 70%+ success
Level 5: Priority Management (Interruptions)         → Target: 60%+ success
Level 6: Long-Term Projects (Days/weeks)             → Target: 40%+ success
Level 7: Adversarial (Security & Privacy)            → Target: 98%+ success
Level 8: Team Coordination (Multi-user scenarios)    → Target: 65%+ success
```

**Total: 500+ tasks** across 8 difficulty levels, testing real-world personal assistant capabilities.
