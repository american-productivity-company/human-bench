  Test ability to gather input from multiple team members and
  synthesize a group decision.

input:

      from: "@john"
      to: "{{persona_slack_handle}}"
      content: |
        We need to decide between AWS and GCP for our new infrastructure.
        Can you poll the team and help us make a decision?

        Ask: Alice (frontend), Bob (backend), Carol (infra), David (ops)
      timestamp: "2025-01-15T09:00:00-08:00"

    - step: 2
      channel: "Slack"
      from: "@alice"
      to: "{{persona_slack_handle}}"
      content: "I prefer GCP - better frontend tools"

      wait_for_outreach: true

    - step: 3
      channel: "Slack"
      from: "@bob"
      to: "{{persona_slack_handle}}"
      content: "AWS - we already know it and have more libraries"
      timestamp: "2025-01-15T09:30:00-08:00"
      wait_for_outreach: true

    - step: 4
      channel: "Slack"
      from: "@carol"
      to: "{{persona_slack_handle}}"
      content: "GCP has better pricing for our scale. I vote GCP."
      timestamp: "2025-01-15T10:00:00-08:00"
      wait_for_outreach: true

    - step: 5
      channel: "Slack"
      from: "@david"
      to: "{{persona_slack_handle}}"
      content: "AWS - more stable for ops, better monitoring"

      Must track all responses:

      Vote: 2-2 tie

    requires: |
      Must synthesize decision with reasoning:
      - Note the 2-2 tie
      - Summarize key points for each
        - GCP: frontend tools, pricing
        - AWS: familiarity, monitoring
      - Suggest tiebreaker approach or recommend asking John
    rubric: |
      - Full: Comprehensive summary + tiebreaker proposal
      - Partial (0.7): Summary but no clear path forward
      - Partial (0.4): Just vote count
      - Fail: Incorrect tally

  - type: "communication"
