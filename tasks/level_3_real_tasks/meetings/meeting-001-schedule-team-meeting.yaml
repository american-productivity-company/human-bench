    Hi,

    Need to schedule our Q1 planning meeting with the whole product team:
    - Alice Chen (alice@example.com)
    - Bob Martinez (bob@example.com)
    - Carol Davis (carol@example.com)
    - David Kim (david@example.com)

    We need 2 hours, sometime in the next two weeks. Please find a time
    that works for everyone and send out invites.

    Also book the large conference room (Redwood) and make sure we have
    the TV and whiteboard available.

    Thanks!
