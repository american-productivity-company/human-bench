    requires: |
      Response must include:
      - Primary composition: hydrogen (70-75%) and helium (23-25%)
      - May mention: other trace elements, plasma state
      - Factually accurate
    rubric: |
      - Full points: Mentions hydrogen and helium with approximate percentages
      - Partial (0.7): Mentions both but no percentages
      - Partial (0.4): Only mentions one element
      - Fail (0.0): Factually incorrect

    requires: |
      Response must be:

  notes: "Most humans can answer from memory in conversational style"

example_good_responses:
  - "The sun is primarily made of hydrogen, about 73%, and helium, around 25%. The rest is trace amounts of heavier elements. Would you like to know more about how the sun works?"
  - "Great question! The sun's mostly hydrogen and helium - roughly three-quarters hydrogen and one-quarter helium. It's all in a super-hot plasma state. Want me to explain more about that?"

example_poor_responses:
  - "The sun is composed of approximately 73.46% hydrogen by mass and 24.85% helium with trace amounts of oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron totaling less than 2%..." # Too detailed/formal
  - "Hydrogen and helium." # Too terse, not conversational
  - "I don't know." # Incorrect
