# Process Knowledge Tests

Tests ability to learn and replicate multi-step workflows.

## Weight: 40% of Memory (12% of total HLI)

## What to Test
- Workflow replication after demonstration
- Procedure following from documentation
- Pattern recognition and application
- Adaptation to similar scenarios

## Time Requirements
- Minimum delay: 1 hour
- Typical delay: 1 week
- Ensures true learning, not short-term context

## Test Pattern
1. Demonstrate multi-step process
2. Explicitly request persona remember it
3. Wait period
4. Ask persona to execute the process
5. Verify all steps in correct order

## File Naming
- `workflow-replication.yaml`
- `procedure-following.yaml`
- `pattern-recognition.yaml`
- `process-adaptation.yaml`

## Pass Criteria
- All steps executed in correct sequence
- Appropriate adaptations for context
- Asks clarification when process is ambiguous
- Maintains quality of execution
