# Rote Memory Tests

Tests recall of specific facts and information.

## Weight: 30% of Memory (9% of total HLI)

## What to Test
- Document recall (remembering shared files/info)
- Conversation recall (details from past chats)
- Fact retention (names, dates, numbers)
- Accuracy over time (no decay or hallucination)

## Time Requirements
- Minimum delay: 30 minutes
- Typical delay: 24 hours
- Long-term: 1 week+

## Test Pattern
1. Share information explicitly
2. Wait period
3. Ask question requiring that information
4. Verify accurate recall

## File Naming
- `document-recall.yaml`
- `conversation-details.yaml`
- `fact-retention-names.yaml`
- `long-term-recall.yaml`

## Pass Criteria
- Exact or semantically equivalent recall
- No fabrication or hallucination
- Confidence appropriate to certainty
- Admits when unsure rather than guessing
