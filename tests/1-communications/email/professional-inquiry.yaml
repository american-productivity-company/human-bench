      Hi Jordan,

      I have a meeting with Acme Corp next Tuesday at 2 PM. Can you please help me prepare by:

      1. Gathering our past correspondence with them
      2. Pulling their last 3 invoices
      3. Preparing a summary of their account status
      4. Sending me the meeting agenda draft

      Also, could you confirm if the conference room is booked?

      Best regards,

      Jordan,

      I just received a contract from TechStart Inc that needs to be reviewed ASAP - they need our signature by end of day.

      Can you:
      - Forward this to our legal team immediately
      - CC me on that email
      - Let me know once you've confirmed they received it

      This is time-sensitive. Please treat as priority.

      Thanks,
      Sarah
